# Intro

Hey there, I am a senior undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), I love to build products that serve humanity. I am particularly interested to work towards developing and designing products. Apart from this I am into content creation and love capturing my life and sharing it with the world. If you think I can be helpful to you feel free to get in touch.

# Currently

I recently completed my internship at [Adobe Systems](https://www.adobe.com/in/), India as a product developer in Creative cloud business unit, soon afterwards I was offered the post of Member of Technical staff at Adobe, which I will be joining in coming summers. I primarily work as product developer but have a broad experience in design and research methodologies.
